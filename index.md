# Who are Darwinist?

It is very difficult to manage the risks with adopting of new technology. Getting to grips with new tech - be it a new marketing platform like Hubspot, a new cloud cloud provider such as Google Cloud Platform or putting more powerful tools in the hands of your employees can be a daunting prospect.

For both business or development teams it can be very difficult to control the *Time to first Value* - the measure of when a new technology starts to deliver value to the organisation. Darwinist is a european company dedicated to improving the process of technology adoption.
